# Mini's Hexdump Analysis

## What We Found

### In out2.txt hexdump:
- Pattern 0xc3a1 appears 59 times throughout the dump
- Found "deadbeef" at offset 0x1c
- Pattern "08 00 00 b0" repeats at offsets 0xf0, 0x1b0, 0x3f0 (possible VA references)
- No clear PKT3 headers in initial scan
- Structure appears to be some kind of ring or command buffer dump

### Key Observations:
1. The hexdump shows repeating structures with consistent spacing
2. No sign of our test values (0xCAFEBABE, 0x12345678)
3. The deadbeef marker suggests this might be initialization data

### Ring State Issues:
- Can't parse ring state from the binary dumps in out.txt
- HQD pointers via UMR still show 0xffffffff
- Ring appears to have data but we can't determine RPTR/WPTR positions

## Current Blockers

1. **IB VA Mapping Fails**:
   - Small sizes (128 bytes) return EINVAL
   - Even though signal BO mapping works fine
   - Might need different flags or alignment

2. **Ring State Unclear**:
   - Binary dumps exist but are unreadable
   - Can't find parsed ring info showing RPTR/WPTR
   - Need better way to verify if ring is consuming our IB

3. **No Execution Evidence**:
   - Signal memory stays 0x12345678
   - No 0xCAFEBABE written
   - Fence signals but no actual work done

## Questions for Mini

1. Is the IB VA mapping size requirement special? Why does 128 bytes fail but 4096 might work?

2. The hexdump shows structured data - is this the ring buffer itself or something else?

3. Should we try using the same domain (GTT) and flags for both signal and IB BOs?

4. Is there a kernel parameter or debugfs file that shows clearer ring state?

## Next Debug Steps

1. Try full page size (4096) for IB BO and VA mapping
2. Use identical flags/domains for all BOs
3. Try SDMA as simpler test case
4. Check if we need special context flags
