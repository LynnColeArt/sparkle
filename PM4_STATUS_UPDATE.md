# PM4 Debug Status Update

## Summary
After extensive debugging, we've determined that GPU packets are successfully submitted but never executed. The issue is not specific to compute or GFX - it's a fundamental problem with how we're initializing the GPU context.

## Key Findings

### 1. Submission Works, Execution Doesn't
- CS ioctl succeeds (returns sequence number)
- Fence completes immediately 
- Memory values remain unchanged
- No GPU hangs or errors in dmesg

### 2. Ring Analysis Shows Kernel Activity
```
Ring dump shows:
000040 fffffff4 00011700 ffff8000 00000000
000050 c0023f00 00b11700 ffff8000 03000098
```
- Kernel schedules other IBs (VA 0xffff800000b11700)
- Our IB (VA 0x800004000) never appears in ring
- HQD pointers show 0xffffffff (uninitialized)

### 3. Neither GFX nor SDMA Works
- GFX WRITE_DATA packet: ❌ No execution
- SDMA WRITE LINEAR: ❌ No execution
- Single BO self-write: ❌ No execution
- Problem is VM/residency/context initialization

### 4. All Mini's Fixes Applied
- ✅ Correct packet encoding (count=4, DST_SEL=5)
- ✅ 32-dword IB alignment
- ✅ 4KB page size for VA mapping
- ✅ Legacy BO list mode
- ✅ Proper chunk pointer structure
- ✅ GFX preamble (CONTEXT_CONTROL, CLEAR_STATE)

## Root Cause Analysis

The kernel driver creates a "bare" context that requires userspace initialization. Mesa/ROCm normally perform this initialization:

1. **Firmware Loading**: May need explicit firmware commands
2. **Ring Buffer Setup**: HQD configuration for compute rings
3. **VM Page Table Updates**: Explicit PTE updates for VA mappings
4. **Context State**: Additional state packets beyond our preamble
5. **Resource Binding**: Special initialization for first-time context use

## What's Missing

We're missing the "userspace driver" layer that sits between the kernel API and actual GPU execution. This layer handles:

- Initial context setup
- Page table management
- Resource validation
- State tracking
- Firmware interface

## Next Steps

1. **Study Mesa radeonsi/radv code**: See how they initialize contexts
2. **Check ROCm runtime**: Compare initialization sequences
3. **Firmware requirements**: Determine if we need PSP/SMU setup
4. **Minimal repro with libdrm_amdgpu**: Use higher-level API that handles init

## Conclusion

We've successfully debugged the packet encoding and submission flow. The remaining issue is that we're trying to use the raw kernel API without the initialization that userspace drivers normally provide. This explains why the kernel schedules its own IBs but not ours - we haven't properly initialized the context for user submissions.
