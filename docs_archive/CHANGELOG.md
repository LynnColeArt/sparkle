# Sporkle Changelog

All notable changes to Sparkle will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-10

### Added
- **Memory Wall Breakthrough**
  - Cache-aware algorithms achieving 294x speedup on reductions
  - Fused kernel operations reducing memory traffic by 2x
  - L1/L2/L3 cache-aware tiling for matrix operations
  - Pure Fortran implementation with no vendor dependencies

- **Thread Safety Configuration**
  - Configurable CPU thread limits to prevent desktop crashes
  - Environment variables: `SPARKLE_MAX_CPU_THREADS` and `SPARKLE_THREAD_RESERVE`
  - Default reserves 2 threads for system stability
  - Safe defaults prevent using all 16 threads on 16-core systems

- **OpenMP Parallelization**
  - Full parallel implementations of core kernels
  - SIMD vectorization hints for compiler optimization
  - Thread-safe execution with configurable limits
  - Performance gains: 1.4-4.6x speedup on 14 cores

### Performance
- **Single-threaded baseline**: 0.5-7.3 GFLOPS
- **Parallel performance**: Up to 17 GFLOPS, 32 GB/s bandwidth
- **Cache-aware reduction**: 294x faster than naive approach
- **Memory bandwidth**: 64% of theoretical DDR4 maximum

### Documentation
- Created "The Sporkle Way" philosophy document
