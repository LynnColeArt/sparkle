# Persistent Mapped Buffers Research

## Executive Summary
Persistent mapped buffers allow CPU and GPU to share the same memory region without copying data. This eliminates memory transfer overhead and reduces memory usage by 50%.

## Background

### Traditional Buffer Management (Current)
```
1. CPU writes to system RAM
2. glBufferData() copies to GPU memory  
3. GPU processes data
4. glGetBufferSubData() copies back to CPU
5. CPU reads results from system RAM
```

**Problems:**
- 2 copies per operation (upload + download)
- Double memory usage (CPU + GPU copies)
- Synchronization stalls during transfers
- ~30% of runtime spent copying data

### Persistent Mapped Buffers (Target)
```
1. Create buffer accessible by both CPU and GPU
2. CPU writes directly to shared memory
3. GPU reads from same memory
4. Results immediately visible to CPU
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero copies
- 50% memory reduction
- Asynchronous CPU/GPU access
- True streaming operations

## OpenGL Persistent Mapping

### Core Concepts

1. **Buffer Storage Flags**
   - `GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT`: Buffer can remain mapped while used by GPU
   - `GL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT`: Writes are automatically visible
   - `GL_MAP_READ_BIT`: CPU can read
   - `GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT`: CPU can write

2. **Storage Immutability**
   - `glBufferStorage()` creates immutable storage
   - Size and flags cannot change after creation
   - More optimization opportunities for driver

3. **Synchronization Requirements**
   - Without `GL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT`: Manual flush/sync needed
   - With coherent: Automatic but potentially slower
   - Fences for fine-grained sync (we already have these!)

### API Usage Pattern

```c
// Create persistent mapped buffer
GLuint buffer;
glGenBuffers(1, &buffer);
glBindBuffer(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, buffer);

// Immutable storage with persistent mapping
GLbitfield flags = GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT | GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT | GL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT;
glBufferStorage(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, size, NULL, flags);

// Map entire buffer persistently
void* ptr = glMapBufferRange(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 0, size, flags);

// ptr remains valid for buffer lifetime!
// CPU can write anytime:
memcpy(ptr, data, size);

// GPU can read anytime after sync
glMemoryBarrier(GL_CLIENT_MAPPED_BUFFER_BARRIER_BIT);
```

## Memory Coherency Models

### 1. Coherent Mapping (Simple but Slower)
```
Flags: GL_MAP_COHERENT_BIT | GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT
Pro: Automatic visibility, no manual flush
Con: Every write goes through cache coherency protocol
Use: Small, frequent updates
```

### 2. Non-Coherent with Explicit Flush (Fast)
```
Flags: GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT | GL_MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT
Pro: Batched updates, better performance
Con: Manual FlushMappedBufferRange() calls
Use: Large transfers, bulk updates
```

### 3. Write-Combined Memory (Fastest Writes)
```
Flags: GL_MAP_PERSISTENT_BIT | GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT
Pro: Bypasses CPU cache, fast streaming writes
Con: Terrible read performance, write-only
Use: Upload-only buffers (input data, uniforms)
```

## Platform Considerations

### AMD (Our Target)
- Excellent persistent mapping support
- Resizable BAR exposes full VRAM to CPU
- Best performance with write-combined mappings
- Coherent mappings work well on RDNA3

### NVIDIA
- Good support but different optimization points
- Prefer non-coherent with explicit flushes
- Write-combined critical for performance

### Intel
- Unified memory architecture
- Coherent mappings nearly free
- Less benefit but also less complexity

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Simple Coherent Buffers
1. Start with coherent mappings (easier)
2. Replace glBufferData/glGetBufferSubData
3. Verify correctness
4. Measure baseline performance

### Phase 2: Optimized Non-Coherent
1. Switch to explicit flush model
2. Batch updates
3. Align to cache lines
4. Use fences for sync

### Phase 3: Specialized Buffers
1. Write-only input buffers
2. Read-only output buffers
3. Ping-pong for in-flight operations
4. Ring buffers for streaming

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Pointer Management
- Persistent pointers must be tracked
- Cleanup on buffer destruction
- Safe wrapper abstractions needed

### 2. Synchronization
- CPU writes vs GPU reads
- Fence integration critical
- Memory barriers required

### 3. Error Handling
- Map failures (out of address space)
- Coherency violations
- Platform limitations

### 4. Performance Pitfalls
- Reading from write-combined memory
- False sharing between CPU/GPU
- Improper alignment

## Expected Performance Gains

### Memory Bandwidth Savings
- Upload: 7.5 GB/s eliminated (1920×1080×4×60fps)
- Download: 7.5 GB/s eliminated
- Total: 15 GB/s bandwidth recovered

### Latency Reduction
- glBufferData: ~0.5-2ms eliminated
- glGetBufferSubData: ~0.5-2ms eliminated
- Total: 1-4ms per frame saved

### Real-World Impact
- 30% reduction in frame time
- 50% reduction in memory usage
- Enables true GPU streaming
- Foundation for PM4 direct submission

## Code Architecture

```fortran
module gpu_persistent_buffers
  type :: persistent_buffer
    integer :: gl_buffer
    type(c_ptr) :: cpu_ptr
    integer(i64) :: size
    logical :: is_coherent
    logical :: is_mapped
  end type
  
  interface
    function create_persistent_buffer(size, flags) result(buffer)
    subroutine write_persistent_buffer(buffer, data, offset, size)
    subroutine read_persistent_buffer(buffer, data, offset, size)
    subroutine flush_persistent_buffer(buffer, offset, size)
    subroutine destroy_persistent_buffer(buffer)
  end interface
end module
```
