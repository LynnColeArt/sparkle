# Mini's Solution Debugging Notes

## Current Status
- **Performance**: 14.4 GFLOPS (3x speedup!) ✅
- **Accuracy**: 134% relative error ❌

## GEMM Call Analysis

### What we're computing:
```
output(K, tile_cols) = weights(K, input_rows) * im2col(input_rows, tile_cols)
```

### Our GEMM call:
```fortran
call gemm_simd_avx512_v2(weights, im2col_tile, output_tile,
                        K, tile_cols, input_rows,
                        1.0, 0.0,
                        K, input_rows, K)
```

### Matrix dimensions:
- A = weights: (K, input_rows) with lda = K ✅
- B = im2col_tile: (input_rows, tile_cols) with ldb = input_rows ✅  
- C = output_tile: (K, tile_cols) with ldc = K ✅

## Hypothesis

The leading dimensions look correct. The issue might be:

1. **Data packing order in im2col** - We reorganized to be row-contiguous, but maybe the ordering is still wrong?

2. **Index calculation bugs** - Off-by-one errors in the im2col packing loops?

3. **Output unpacking** - When we write results back, are we reading from the right locations?

## Next Steps

1. Add debug prints to verify first few elements match between implementations
2. Test with tile_size = 1 to eliminate tiling complexity
3. Verify the im2col buffer contents match between fused and unfused

The fact that we're getting consistent 134% error (not random garbage) suggests a systematic indexing issue rather than memory corruption.
