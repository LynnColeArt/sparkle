- **Issue**: "Compute shader not compiled" error in production context
- **Root Cause**: EGL context creation or shader compilation failing
- **Fix Strategy**: Add detailed error logging, compare to working test harness
- **Success Metric**: GPU returns positive execution time, not -1

#### 1.2 Validate GPU Performance in Production
- **Target**: Achieve 451 GFLOPS through `sparkle_conv2d` module
- **Test**: ResNet-50 first layer (224×224×3 → 112×112×64, 7×7 kernel)

subroutine conv2d_cpu_optimized(input, weights, output, ...)
  ! 1. Transform to cache-friendly layout (im2col)
  call im2col_cache_optimal(input, input_matrix, ...)
  
  ! 2. Use blocked GEMM with universal memory patterns
  call gemm_universal_memory(input_matrix, weights, output, ...)
end subroutine
```

This weekend we complete the transition from "CUDA replacement" to "universal memory optimization framework." We prove that the same memory access patterns that make GPUs fast also make CPUs fast.

When we're done, Sparkle will be the first framework where:
- **One codebase** optimizes for all devices
- **Universal principles** replace device-specific hacks  
- **Memory optimization** is the unifying abstraction
- **Performance** comes from understanding memory, not device APIs

This is the foundation for the "People's AI" vision - a framework so optimized and universal that it democratizes high-performance computing across any hardware.

Let's make history! 🚀
