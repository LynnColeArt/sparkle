# Mini's Diagnosis CONFIRMED! ðŸŽ¯

## The Smoking Gun
Mini nailed it - we have a **leading dimension bug** in our fused GEMM call.

## What's Happening

### Unfused (works correctly):
```fortran
! Full matrices, tightly packed
call gemm_simd_avx512(weights, input_matrix, output, &
                     K, input_matrix_cols, input_matrix_rows, &
                     1.0, 0.0)
```
- Passes FULL matrices that are tightly packed in memory
- GEMM assumes tight packing (no stride parameters)
- Works perfectly because assumption is correct

### Fused (broken):
```fortran
! Slices of larger buffers
call gemm_simd_avx512(weights, im2col_tile(1:input_rows*tile_cols), &
                     output_tile(1:K*tile_cols), &
                     K, tile_cols, input_rows, &
                     1.0, 0.0)
```
- Passes SLICES of larger allocated buffers
- GEMM still assumes tight packing
- BREAKS because the slices aren't contiguous in the expected way

## The Problem

Our `gemm_simd_avx512` doesn't support leading dimensions (LDA, LDB, LDC). It assumes:
- A is stored as mÃ—k with stride m
- B is stored as kÃ—n with stride k  
- C is stored as mÃ—n with stride m

But when we allocate larger buffers and use slices, this assumption breaks!

## Why Small Cases Work
- Small 3Ã—3 test: K is small, memory happens to align correctly
- Large 64Ã—64Ã—56Ã—56 test: K=576 (64Ã—3Ã—3), stride mismatches cause havoc

## The Fix

We need to either:
1. **Add LDA/LDB/LDC parameters to our GEMM** (proper solution)
2. **Copy data to temporary contiguous buffers** (quick fix, loses performance)
3. **Rethink our tiling strategy** to maintain contiguous access

Mini's surgical validation confirmed:
- It's not floating point precision
- It's not accumulation order
- It's pure memory access pattern corruption from wrong strides

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper leading dimension support in GEMM
2. Or restructure the tiling to maintain contiguous memory layout
3. Retest with the fix

Mini absolutely crushed this diagnosis! ðŸ”¥
