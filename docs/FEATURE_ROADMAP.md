# Sporkle/Sporkle Feature Roadmap

## Vision
Create a global mesh network where anyone can contribute compute power for AI training, breaking the monopoly of large corporations on AGI development.

## Core Principles
1. **Zero Dependencies**: Direct hardware access, no vendor runtimes
2. **Pure Fortran**: Accessible to scientists and researchers  
3. **Heterogeneous**: CPU, GPU, FPGA, and future accelerators
4. **Mesh-First**: Distributed by design, not an afterthought
5. **Democratic**: Every device matters, from laptops to data centers
