# Layer 3: Dynamic Shader System Progress

## âœ… Completed
1. **GPU Baseline Established**: 
   - 334-400 GFLOPS on RX 7900 XTX (slightly below 451 GFLOPS reference)
   - Working GPU execution via OpenGL reference implementation

2. **Dynamic Shader System Integrated**:
   - Successfully generates RDNA3-optimized shader variants
   - Creates 4 variants per kernel:
     - `rdna_basic_64`: 64 threads (2 waves) 
     - `rdna_large_256`: 256 threads (8 waves)
     - `rdna_lds_64`: Using local data share
     - `rdna3_dual_issue`: Dual-issue optimization
   - Performance tracking system active
   - Architecture detection working (correctly identifies RDNA3)

## ðŸ”¦ Current Status
The dynamic shader system is generating optimized GLSL compute shaders for RDNA3, but we need to add the ability to compile and execute these custom shaders at runtime.

## ðŸš§ Missing Pieces
1. **Runtime Shader Compilation**: Need to add functions to:
   - Compile GLSL source code at runtime
   - Hot-swap shaders without restarting
   - Cache compiled shader programs

2. **Custom Shader Execution**: Need to:
   - Execute convolution with dynamically compiled shaders
   - Pass the correct shader program ID to GPU execution

3. **Performance Feedback Loop**: Need to:
   - Measure actual performance of each variant
   - Update the shader system's performance tracking
   - Converge on optimal variant over time

## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis
Current GPU performance shows high variability (334-724 GFLOPS), suggesting:
- GPU boost behavior affecting measurements
- Possible thermal throttling during repeated runs
- Need for more stable benchmarking methodology

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Add runtime shader compilation API to GPU reference implementation
2. Implement shader hot-swapping in the execution path
3. Connect performance measurements to shader variant selection
4. Test impact of RDNA3 dual-issue optimization
