# QA Findings Summary: Real Implementations Exist!

## Good News
The mocks and placeholders in production code are NOT because functionality is missing - we have REAL implementations:

### Real GPU Implementations Found:
1. **PM4 Direct Submission** (`sporkle_pm4_compute.f90`)
   - ✅ Real shader compilation via `pm4_compile_shader`
   - ✅ Loads actual RDNA3 ISA shaders
   - ✅ GPU memory allocation and VA mapping
   - ✅ Direct kernel submission

2. **RDNA3 ISA Shaders** (`sporkle_rdna3_shaders.f90`)
   - ✅ `get_simple_copy_shader()` - real GPU machine code
   - ✅ `get_vector_add_shader()` - real GPU machine code
   - ❌ Missing: `get_conv2d_shader()` - needs to be added

3. **AMDGPU Direct Interface** (`sporkle_amdgpu_direct.f90`)
   - ✅ `amdgpu_allocate_buffer` - real GPU memory allocation
   - ✅ `amdgpu_map_buffer` - CPU/GPU memory mapping
   - ✅ `amdgpu_map_va` - GPU virtual address mapping
   - ✅ Direct ioctl kernel interface

## The Problem
The production code hasn't been updated to use these real implementations. It still has placeholders because it was written before the PM4 path was complete.

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Removed mock GPU OpenGL implementation
2. ✅ Fixed hardcoded shader address in `pm4_safe_submit.f90` to use `pm4_compile_shader`

## Still TODO:
1. Wire other production files to use real PM4/AMDGPU implementations
2. Add conv2d ISA shader to RDNA3 shaders module
3. Update memory allocation to use AMDGPU direct interface
4. Replace fake GPU pointers with real VA addresses

## Conclusion
We're much closer to production-ready than the placeholders suggest. The real GPU infrastructure exists - it just needs to be connected!
