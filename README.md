# Sparkle ✨ - The People's AI Infrastructure

**Democratizing AI compute through heterogeneous device orchestration**

## 🚧 Current State: Building Live!

**We're starting from scratch and building in public!** This project is in its earliest stages - we literally just wrote the first lines of code. Everything you see here is being developed live, and we invite you to join us on this journey.

### What's Working Now:
- ✅ Basic device abstraction (CPU support)
- ✅ Mesh topology design
- ✅ Smart scheduling with cost models
- ✅ Collective operations (all-reduce, broadcast)
- ✅ Device discovery framework

### What's Coming:
- 🔨 Actual GPU execution (CUDA/ROCm/Level Zero)
- 🔨 Memory management
- 🔨 Kernel abstraction
- 🔨 Network mesh communication
- 🔨 Real-world examples

**Want to help?** Jump right in! Whether you're fixing a typo, testing on your hardware, or implementing GPU backends - every contribution matters. This is truly a community project from day one.

Sparkle is a device-agnostic compute orchestration framework that enables ANY device - from high-end GPUs to old laptops - to contribute to a global mesh of computational power. Built entirely in Fortran with Pythonic design principles.

## 🌟 Vision

AGI is coming. When it does, computational power will determine who shapes the future. Sparkle ensures everyone has a seat at the table - not just those with server farms.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Universal Device Support**: CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPUs, and future accelerators
- **Mesh Topology**: Devices communicate directly, no hierarchical bottlenecks  
- **Smart Orchestration**: Work distributed based on actual device capabilities
- **Self-Healing**: Device failures are handled gracefully - the mesh adapts
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Pure Fortran implementation, no proprietary dependencies
- **Pythonic API**: Clean, intuitive interfaces despite being in Fortran

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```fortran
program hello_sparkle
  use sparkle
  implicit none
  
  type(sparkle_context) :: ctx
  type(sparkle_array) :: data
  
  ! Initialize Sparkle - it discovers all available devices
  ctx = sparkle_init(topology="mesh")
  
  ! Create distributed array
  data = ctx%array(shape=[1000000], dtype=real32)
  
  ! Sparkle automatically distributes work across available devices
  call sparkle_map(ctx, sqrt_kernel, data)
  
end program
```

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Fortran compiler (gfortran 9+ recommended)
- CMake 3.10+
- (Optional) CUDA Toolkit for NVIDIA GPU support
- (Optional) ROCm for AMD GPU support

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LynnColeArt/sparkle.git
cd sparkle
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## 🤝 Contributing Compute

Want to contribute your idle compute to the global mesh? It's as simple as:

```fortran
program contribute
  use sparkle
  type(sparkle_context) :: ctx
  
  ctx = sparkle_init(mode="contributor")
  call ctx%set_limits(cpu_percent=50, gpu_percent=80)
  call ctx%join_mesh("global.sparkle.network")
  
  ! Your devices are now part of the people's AI infrastructure!
end program
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Sparkle consists of several key components:

- **Device Abstraction Layer**: Unified interface for all compute devices
- **Mesh Topology Manager**: Handles device discovery and P2P communication
- **Smart Scheduler**: Cost-model based work distribution
- **Collective Operations**: Distributed primitives (all-reduce, broadcast, etc.)
- **Memory Manager**: Transparent handling of device/host memory

## 🤖 Use Cases

- **Distributed AI Training**: Train models across heterogeneous devices
- **Community Compute**: Pool resources for researchers without grants
- **Edge Intelligence**: Coordinate inference across IoT devices
- **Volunteer Computing**: SETI@home-style projects for AI/ML

## 📈 Performance

Sparkle is designed for efficiency:
- Minimal overhead (<5% vs native implementations)
- Intelligent collective algorithms (ring, tree, direct)
- Cache-aware CPU kernels
- Zero-copy operations where possible

## 🌍 Join the Movement

Sparkle is more than code - it's a movement to democratize AI compute. Whether you have a gaming rig, an old laptop, or a cluster of servers, you can contribute to the people's AI infrastructure.

**Together, we can ensure AI serves everyone, not just those who can afford server farms.**
