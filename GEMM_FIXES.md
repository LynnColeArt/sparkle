# Critical GEMM Bug Fixes Summary

## B Matrix Indexing Bug (Fixed)

The critical bug was in the B matrix indexing during column-major multiplication:

### Incorrect (causes wrong results):
```fortran
B(kk + (j-1)*k)  ! This accesses B[kk][j] incorrectly
```

### Correct:
```fortran
B((j-1)*k + kk)  ! This correctly accesses B[kk][j] in column-major
```

### Files Fixed:
- ✅ `src/production/gemm_simd_optimized.f90` - Fixed
- ✅ `src/production/gemm_simd_optimized_v2.f90` - Fixed  
- ✅ `src/production/gemm_simd_prefetch.f90` - Already correct
- ✅ `src/reference/gemm_simd_optimized.f90` - Already correct

## Cache Optimization

Reduced tile sizes from 64×64×256 (144KB) to 32×64×64 (20KB) to fit in L1 cache:
- Working set calculation: 32*64*4 + 64*64*4 + 32*64*4 = 8KB + 16KB + 8KB = 32KB
- Most modern CPUs have 32KB L1 data cache

## Missing Vectorization Directives

Added missing `!$omp simd` directives in gemm_simd_optimized_v2.f90 to ensure proper vectorization.

## OpenMP Scheduling

Changed from `schedule(dynamic,1)` to `schedule(static)` for better thread locality and reduced overhead.

## Performance Impact

These fixes ensure:
1. **Correctness**: B matrix is accessed properly for column-major layout
2. **Cache efficiency**: Working set fits in L1 cache
3. **Vectorization**: SIMD instructions are properly generated
4. **Thread efficiency**: Static scheduling reduces overhead
