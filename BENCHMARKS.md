### 3.3 Performance Characterization

#### 3.3.1 Cache Hierarchy Effects

Our empirical analysis reveals distinct performance regimes correlated with dataset size:

1. **L1/L2 Cache Resident** (1K-10K elements): Performance improvement ratios of 5-14x between cold and warm execution, indicating significant cache residency benefits
2. **L3 Cache Resident** (100K-1M elements): Moderate improvement ratios of approximately 2.5x
3. **Memory Bandwidth Limited** (10M+ elements): Negligible difference between cold and warm execution, confirming memory bandwidth saturation

#### 3.3.2 Memory Bandwidth Utilization

Observed memory bandwidth characteristics:
- Peak measured bandwidth: 21.8 GB/s (dot product operation)
- Sustained streaming bandwidth: 6-7 GB/s
- Theoretical DDR4 maximum: ~50 GB/s
- Bandwidth efficiency: 15-40% of theoretical peak

#### 3.3.3 Computational Throughput

Single-threaded CPU performance measurements:
- Elementary operations (addition, scaling): 0.5-1.0 GFLOPS
- Complex operations (dot product): 7.3 GFLOPS
- Optimized kernels (matrix multiplication): 43.5 GFLOPS

### 3.4 Cache-Aware Algorithm Analysis

The cache-aware sum reduction algorithm demonstrates the profound impact of memory access patterns on performance:

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Process data in L1 cache-sized blocks
- Employ hierarchical reduction tree

call sporkle_run(kernel, context)
call cpu_time(end_time)
cold_time = (end_time - start_time) * 1000.0

! Warm-up phase
do i = 1, warmup_iterations
  call sporkle_run_quiet(kernel, context)
end do

! Warm execution measurements
do i = 1, benchmark_iterations

  call sporkle_run_quiet(kernel, context)
  call cpu_time(end_time)
  times(i) = (end_time - start_time) * 1000.0
end do
```

### 6.2 Statistical Analysis

Performance metrics are computed using standard statistical methods:
- Mean: Arithmetic average of warm execution times
- Standard deviation: Measure of performance variability
- Percentiles: 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles for distribution characterization
