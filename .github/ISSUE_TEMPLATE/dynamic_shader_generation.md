## Overview

Implement a dynamic shader generation system that automatically discovers optimal GPU implementations through systematic experimentation and genetic algorithms.

## Motivation

- Current GPU optimization relies on vendor documentation which may be incomplete
- Different GPU architectures have undocumented performance characteristics  
- Manual optimization is time-consuming and doesn't scale
- Community knowledge could benefit everyone

## Proposed Solution

Build a system that:
1. **Generates shader variants** from templates with variable parameters
2. **Tests performance** empirically on actual hardware
3. **Evolves optimizations** using genetic algorithms
4. **Discovers patterns** through anomaly detection
5. **Shares knowledge** via community database

## Technical Approach

- Template-based shader generation
- Parameter space exploration
- Genetic algorithm for optimization evolution
- Sandboxed execution for safety
- Performance anomaly detection
- Distributed discovery network

## Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites (MUST complete first)
- [ ] Get basic compute kernels working
- [ ] Establish performance baseline
- [ ] Complete adaptive kernel framework
- [ ] Have reliable benchmarking

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
- [ ] Shader template system
- [ ] Parameter configuration
- [ ] Safe execution sandbox

### Phase 2: Optimization
- [ ] Parameter sweep engine
- [ ] Hill climbing optimizer
- [ ] Performance database

### Phase 3: Evolution
- [ ] Genetic algorithm implementation
- [ ] Mutation strategies
- [ ] Fitness evaluation

### Phase 4: Discovery
- [ ] Anomaly detection
- [ ] Pattern recognition
- [ ] Knowledge base

### Phase 5: Community
- [ ] Distributed collection
- [ ] Privacy/security measures
- [ ] Result aggregation

## Success Criteria

- Find optimizations that outperform vendor libraries
- Discover at least 10 undocumented performance patterns
- Scale across multiple GPU architectures
- Maintain safety and reliability

## Risks

- Scope creep (this is very ambitious!)
- May find vendor-specific bugs/limitations
- Could generate invalid/dangerous code
- Performance regression if not careful

## Timeline

This is a **FUTURE** feature. Do not implement until:
1. Core Sporkle functionality is complete
2. Basic GPU kernels are working and benchmarked
3. We have proven the adaptive kernel concept

Estimated: 6-8 months after core completion

**Note**: This represents the "mad science" aspect of Sporkle - turning every GPU into a research platform for discovering optimizations!
